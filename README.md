Hello, welcome to my github space. My name is Cornelius Chisom, and it's a pleasure that you made it here.

I am a Software Developer who loves writing programs in Python. I also code in JavaScript, but only when necessary. 
We live in interesting time for tech, where AI and other technological advancements are shaping the world around us, and for someone like me, having my foot prints of this legend is the little thing that is worth the world. So, I have come to accepting my reality in this ever growing tech space, to contribute, to build, and to give all I could to the community.

I am open to learning new stuff and taking new challenges to whichever place they take me to.
