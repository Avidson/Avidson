- 👋 Hi, I’m @Avidson Cornelius Chisom
- 👀 I’m a pragmatic web programmer with few years of experience in my credit box. I work a lot with Python as a language and Django as the framework. 
  Before going fully into web development, 
  I have had experience working as a Computer Network Associate trained by Cisco Systems. I have been working as a freelance developer, and so far I have been able to optimally 
  satisfy most of my client's need(s)...
- 🌱 I’m currently building experience in AI and Machine Learning (Python)...
- 💞️ If you need a friend to code with, hit me up! I am very open to possibilities, who knows if that might be the breakthrough point in our careers ...
